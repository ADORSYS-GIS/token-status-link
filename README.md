# Keycloak Token Status Plugin

This plugin lets Keycloak send the status of long-lived tokens or verifiable credentials to an external status list
server. It helps you quickly revoke credentials before they expire. The plugin uses the `REVOKE_GRANT` event to detect
when a credential should be marked as revoked.

The primary use case is for verifiable credentials or other long-lived tokens that may need to be invalidated before
their expiration (for example, if a credential is compromised or must be revoked for compliance reasons). The
`REVOKE_GRANT` event is used as the closest available event to signal such revocations. Please note that this event may
not cover all possible credential types, but it is currently the best fit for this purpose in Keycloak.

The status list server should implement the OAuth 2.0 Status List pattern.

## Features

- Track long-lived token revocation events
- Publish token status to an external status list server
- Support for different token statuses (VALID, REVOKED)
- Configurable connection parameters with sensible defaults
- Robust retry mechanism for failed publishing attempts with exponential backoff
- Secure communication with TLS 1.2/1.3
- Support for authentication with the status list server
- Detailed logging with unique request IDs for better traceability
- Proper handling of realm public keys and signing algorithms

## Configuration Properties

The plugin can be configured at the realm level with the following properties:

| Property                          | Description                                  | Default Value                          |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `status-list-enabled`             | Enables or disables the status list service  | `true`                                 |
| `status-list-server-url`          | URL of the status list server                | `https://statuslist.eudi-adorsys.com/` |
| `status-list-token-issuer-prefix` | Prefix for building the Token Issuer ID      | Generated UUID                         |
| `status-list-connect-timeout`     | Connection timeout in milliseconds           | `30000`                                |
| `status-list-read-timeout`        | Read timeout in milliseconds                 | `60000`                                |
| `status-list-retry-count`         | Number of retry attempts for failed requests | `-1`                                   |

## Supported Events

The plugin processes the following Keycloak events:

- REVOKE_GRANT

## Token Status Record Format

The plugin sends token status information to the status list server in the following JSON format, compliant with the
OAuth 2.0 Status List specification:

```json
{
  "sub": "unique-token-identifier",
  "iss": "realm-name",
  "issuer": "realm-name",
  "public_key": "realm-public-key",
  "alg": "RS256",
  "status": 0,
  "iat": 1717006530,
  "exp": 1717010130,
  "revoked_at": 1717008330,
  "type": "oauth2",
  "status_reason": "Client: client-id, User: user-id, Reason: Token revoked"
}
```

### Fields Explanation

- `sub`: The token identifier (credential ID)
- `iss`: The issuer identifier (realm name)
- `issuer`: The issuer name (realm name)
- `public_key`: The realm's public key used for token verification
- `alg`: The signing algorithm used (e.g., RS256)
- `status`: Token status (0 = VALID, 1 = REVOKED)
- `iat`: Issued at timestamp (seconds since epoch)
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp (seconds since epoch)
- `revoked_at`: Revocation timestamp for revoked tokens (seconds since epoch)
- `type`: Credential type, always "oauth2" for this plugin
- `status_reason`: Human-readable explanation of token status, including client and user IDs

## Installation

1. Build the plugin using Maven:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

2. Copy the resulting JAR file from `target/keycloak-token-status-plugin-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` to Keycloak's `providers`
   directory.

3. Restart Keycloak to load the plugin.

4. Enable the event listener in your Keycloak realm:
    - Navigate to the Realm Settings
    - Go to Events tab
    - Add "token-status-event-listener" to the Event Listeners

5. Configure the plugin using the realm attributes described in the Configuration Properties section above.

### Configuring Keycloak's credential issuance to use the Status List protocol mapper

For the Status List protocol mapper to come into effect, you need to explicitly attach it to the client scope
corresponding to a specific credential's configuration. Below is a sample such configuration:

```json
{
  "name": "status-list-claim-mapper",
  "protocol": "oid4vc",
  "protocolMapper": "oid4vc-status-list-claim-mapper",
  "config": {}
}
```

## Performance Considerations

- The plugin performs non-blocking HTTP requests to minimize impact on Keycloak performance
- Failed requests are retried with exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 3s, etc.)
- Connection and read timeouts are configurable to prevent hanging connections

## Security Features

- Secure communication using TLS 1.2/1.3
- Bearer token authentication support for the status list server
- Proper handling of Keycloak's realm public keys and algorithms
- No sensitive information is logged beyond what's necessary for debugging

## Development and Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
mvn test
```

### Integration Testing with a Status List Server

For manual testing with a local status list server:

1. Configure the `status-list-server-url` to point to your test server
2. Enable debug logging to see detailed request/response information

### TODO

- Remove logic depending on `REVOKE_GRANT` events. These merely do not serve the purpose of this plugin.
- Unify HTTP interaction with the status list server in the dedicated `StatusListService` class.
- Improve persistence layer as the plugin interacts with the database.
- Drop unnecessary configuration properties.
- Implement HTTP retry strategy within the framework of the HTTP client library, not manually. For readability.
